# AauScheduleScraping
Scrapes schedules from Aalborg University (AAU) and notifies subscribers of any changes. 

## About

The scraper is part of the [DiscordBot](https://github.com/roedebaron/DiscordBot) microservice architecture.

## Getting Started

It is possible to run the application independently of the other services in the microservice architecture (except the postgres database), however, the scraper is currently set up to call the endpoint of the DiscordBot when any changes occur. Simply replace the URL in order to integrate with your own service. 

Either run the project natively or use the provided Dockerfile.

## Usage
